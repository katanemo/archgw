Overview
============
`Arch <https://github.com/katanemo/arch>`_ is a smart edge and AI gateway for AI-native apps - one that is natively designed to handle and process prompts, not just network traffic.

Built by contributors to the widely adopted `Envoy Proxy <https://www.envoyproxy.io/>`_, Arch handles the *pesky low-level work* in building agentic apps — like applying guardrails, clarifying vague user input, routing prompts to the right agent, and unifying access to any LLM. It’s a language and framework friendly infrastructure layer designed to help you build and ship agentic apps faster.


In this documentation, you will learn how to quickly set up Arch to trigger API calls via prompts, apply prompt guardrails without writing any application-level logic,
simplify the interaction with upstream LLMs, and improve observability all while simplifying your application development process.
