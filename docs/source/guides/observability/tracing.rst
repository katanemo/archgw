Tracing
=======

Overview
--------

`OpenTelemetry <https://opentelemetry.io/>`_ is an open-source observability framework providing APIs
and instrumentation for generating, collecting, processing, and exporting telemetry data, such as traces,
metrics, and logs. Its flexible design supports a wide range of backends and seamlessly integrates with
modern application tools. A key feature of OpenTelemetry is its commitment to standards like the
`W3C Trace Context <https://www.w3.org/TR/trace-context/>`_

**Tracing** is a critical tool that allows developers to visualize and understand the flow of
requests in an AI application. With tracing, you can capture a detailed view of how requests propagate
through various services and components, which is crucial for **debugging**, **performance optimization**,
and understanding complex AI agent architectures like Co-pilots.

**Arch** propagates trace context using the W3C Trace Context standard, specifically through the
``traceparent`` header. This allows each component in the system to record its part of the request
flow, enabling **end-to-end tracing** across the entire application. By using OpenTelemetry, Arch ensures
that developers can capture this trace data consistently and in a format compatible with various observability
tools.

Benefits of Using ``Traceparent`` Headers
-----------------------------------------

- **Standardization**: The W3C Trace Context standard ensures compatibility across ecosystem tools, allowing
  traces to be propagated uniformly through different layers of the system.
- **Ease of Integration**: OpenTelemetry's design allows developers to easily integrate tracing with minimal
  changes to their codebase, enabling quick adoption of end-to-end observability.
- **Interoperability**: Works seamlessly with popular tracing tools like AWS X-Ray, Datadog, Jaeger, and many others,
  making it easy to visualize traces in the tools you're already usi

How to Initiate A Trace
-----------------------

1. **Enable Tracing Configuration**: Simply add the ``random_sampling`` in ``tracing`` section to 100`` flag to in the :ref:`listener <arch_overview_listeners>` config

2. **Trace Context Propagation**: Arch automatically propagates the ``traceparent`` header. When a request is received, Arch will:

   - Generate a new ``traceparent`` header if one is not present.
   - Extract the trace context from the ``traceparent`` header if it exists.
   - Start a new span representing its processing of the request.
   - Forward the ``traceparent`` header to downstream services.

3. **Sampling Policy**: The 100 in ``random_sampling: 100`` means that all the requests as sampled for tracing.
   You can adjust this value from 0-100.


Trace Propagation
-----------------

Arch uses the W3C Trace Context standard for trace propagation, which relies on the ``traceparent`` header.
This header carries tracing information in a standardized format, enabling interoperability between different
tracing systems.

Header Format
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``traceparent`` header has the following format::

   traceparent: {version}-{trace-id}-{parent-id}-{trace-flags}

- ``{version}``: The version of the Trace Context specification (e.g., ``00``).
- ``{trace-id}``: A 16-byte (32-character hexadecimal) unique identifier for the trace.
- ``{parent-id}``: An 8-byte (16-character hexadecimal) identifier for the parent span.
- ``{trace-flags}``: Flags indicating trace options (e.g., sampling).

Instrumentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To integrate AI tracing, your application needs to follow a few simple steps. The steps
below are very common practice, and not unique to Arch, when you reading tracing headers and export
`spans <https://docs.lightstep.com/docs/understand-distributed-tracing>`_ for distributed tracing.

- Read the ``traceparent`` header from incoming requests.
- Start new spans as children of the extracted context.
- Include the ``traceparent`` header in outbound requests to propagate trace context.
- Send tracing data to a collector or tracing backend to export spans

Example with OpenTelemetry in Python
************************************

Install OpenTelemetry packages:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install opentelemetry-api opentelemetry-sdk opentelemetry-exporter-otlp
    $ pip install opentelemetry-instrumentation-requests

Set up the tracer and exporter:

.. code-block:: python

   from opentelemetry import trace
   from opentelemetry.exporter.otlp.proto.grpc.trace_exporter import OTLPSpanExporter
   from opentelemetry.instrumentation.requests import RequestsInstrumentor
   from opentelemetry.sdk.resources import Resource
   from opentelemetry.sdk.trace import TracerProvider
   from opentelemetry.sdk.trace.export import BatchSpanProcessor

   # Define the service name
   resource = Resource(attributes={
       "service.name": "customer-support-agent"
   })

   # Set up the tracer provider and exporter
   tracer_provider = TracerProvider(resource=resource)
   otlp_exporter = OTLPSpanExporter(endpoint="otel-collector:4317", insecure=True)
   span_processor = BatchSpanProcessor(otlp_exporter)
   tracer_provider.add_span_processor(span_processor)
   trace.set_tracer_provider(tracer_provider)

   # Instrument HTTP requests
   RequestsInstrumentor().instrument()

Handle incoming requests:

.. code-block:: python

   from opentelemetry import trace
   from opentelemetry.propagate import extract, inject
   import requests

   def handle_request(request):
       # Extract the trace context
       context = extract(request.headers)
       tracer = trace.get_tracer(__name__)

       with tracer.start_as_current_span("process_customer_request", context=context):
           # Example of processing a customer request
           print("Processing customer request...")

           # Prepare headers for outgoing request to payment service
           headers = {}
           inject(headers)

           # Make outgoing request to external service (e.g., payment gateway)
           response = requests.get("http://payment-service/api", headers=headers)

           print(f"Payment service response: {response.content}")


AI Agent Tracing Visualization Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following is an example of tracing for an AI-powered customer support system.
A customer interacts with AI agents, which forward their requests through different
specialized services and external systems.

::

    +--------------------------+
    |   Customer Interaction   |
    +--------------------------+
               |
               v
    +--------------------------+        +--------------------------+
    |  Agent 1 (Main - Arch)   | ---->  | External Payment Service |
    +--------------------------+        +--------------------------+
               |                                  |
               v                                  v
    +--------------------------+        +--------------------------+
    |  Agent 2 (Support - Arch)| ---->  |   Internal Tech Support  |
    +--------------------------+        +--------------------------+
               |                                  |
               v                                  v
    +--------------------------+        +--------------------------+
    | Agent 3 (Orders- Arch)   | ---->  |   Inventory Management   |
    +--------------------------+        +--------------------------+

Trace Breakdown:
****************

- Customer Interaction:
    - Span 1: Customer initiates a request via the AI-powered chatbot for billing support (e.g., asking for payment details).

- AI Agent 1 (Main - Arch):
    - Span 2: AI Agent 1 (Main) processes the request and identifies it as related to billing, forwarding the request
      to an external payment service.
    - Span 3: AI Agent 1 determines that additional technical support is needed for processing and forwards the request
      to AI Agent 2.

- External Payment Service:
    - Span 4: The external payment service processes the payment-related request (e.g., verifying payment status) and sends
      the response back to AI Agent 1.

- AI Agent 2 (Tech - Arch):
    - Span 5: AI Agent 2, responsible for technical queries, processes a request forwarded from AI Agent 1 (e.g., checking for
      any account issues).
    - Span 6: AI Agent 2 forwards the query to Internal Tech Support for further investigation.

- Internal Tech Support:
    - Span 7: Internal Tech Support processes the request (e.g., resolving account access issues) and responds to AI Agent 2.

- AI Agent 3 (Orders - Arch):
    - Span 8: AI Agent 3 handles order-related queries. AI Agent 1 forwards the request to AI Agent 3 after payment verification
      is completed.
    - Span 9: AI Agent 3 forwards a request to the Inventory Management system to confirm product availability for a pending order.

- Inventory Management:
    - Span 10: The Inventory Management system checks stock and availability and returns the information to AI Agent 3.

------------------------------

AWS X-Ray
~~~~~~~~~

To send tracing data to `AWS X-Ray <https://aws.amazon.com/xray/>`_ :

1. **Configure OpenTelemetry Collector**: Set up the collector to export traces to AWS X-Ray.

   Collector configuration (``otel-collector-config.yaml``):

   .. code-block:: yaml

      receivers:
        otlp:
          protocols:
            grpc:

      processors:
        batch:

      exporters:
        awsxray:
          region: <Your-Aws-Region>

      service:
        pipelines:
          traces:
            receivers: [otlp]
            processors: [batch]
            exporters: [awsxray]

2. **Deploy the Collector**: Run the collector as a Docker container, Kubernetes pod, or standalone service.
3. **Ensure AWS Credentials**: Provide AWS credentials to the collector, preferably via IAM roles.
4. **Verify Traces**: Access the AWS X-Ray console to view your traces.

Datadog
~~~~~~~

Datadog

To send tracing data to `Datadog <https://docs.datadoghq.com/getting_started/tracing/>`_:

1. **Configure OpenTelemetry Collector**: Set up the collector to export traces to Datadog.

   Collector configuration (``otel-collector-config.yaml``):

   .. code-block:: yaml

      receivers:
        otlp:
          protocols:
            grpc:

      processors:
        batch:

3. **Deploy the Collector**: Run the collector in your environment.
4. **Verify Traces**: Access the Datadog APM dashboard to view your traces.

Langtrace
~~~~~~~~~

Langtrace is an observability tool designed specifically for large language models (LLMs). It helps you capture, analyze, and understand how LLMs are used in your applications including those built using Arch.

To send tracing data to `Langtrace <https://docs.langtrace.ai/supported-integrations/llm-tools/arch>`_:

1. **Configure Arch**: Make sure Arch is installed and setup correctly. For more information, refer to the `installation guide <https://github.com/katanemo/archgw?tab=readme-ov-file#prerequisites>`_.

2. **Install Langtrace**: Install the Langtrace SDK.:

   .. code-block:: console

        $ pip install langtrace-python-sdk

3. **Set Environment Variables**: Provide your Langtrace API key.

   .. code-block:: console

        $ export LANGTRACE_API_KEY=<Your-Langtrace-Api-Key>

4. **Trace Requests**: Once you have Langtrace set up, you can start tracing requests.

   Here's an example of how to trace a request using the Langtrace Python SDK:

   .. code-block:: python

      import os
      from langtrace_python_sdk import langtrace  # Must precede any llm module imports
      from openai import OpenAI

      langtrace.init(api_key=os.environ['LANGTRACE_API_KEY'])

      client = OpenAI(api_key=os.environ['OPENAI_API_KEY'], base_url="http://localhost:12000/v1")

      response = client.chat.completions.create(
          model="gpt-4o-mini",
          messages=[
              {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant"},
              {"role": "user", "content": "Hello"},
          ]
      )

      print(chat_completion.choices[0].message.content)

5. **Verify Traces**: Access the Langtrace dashboard to view your traces.


Best Practices
--------------

- **Consistent Instrumentation**: Ensure all services propagate the ``traceparent`` header.
- **Secure Configuration**: Protect sensitive data and secure communication between services.
- **Performance Monitoring**: Be mindful of the performance impact and adjust sampling rates accordingly.
- **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling to prevent tracing issues from affecting your application.

Summary
----------

By leveraging the ``traceparent`` header for trace context propagation, Arch enables developers to implement
tracing efficiently. This approach simplifies the process of collecting and analyzing tracing data in common
tools like AWS X-Ray and Datadog, enhancing observability and facilitating faster debugging and optimization.
